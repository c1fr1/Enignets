 - use https://github.com/anatawa12/compile-time-constant
 - make samplers binding = 0 by default (unless this is already defined in gl specs?)
 - create a renderbuffer class
 - compare Simplex2v2d with Dark Forest version
 - clean collision
 - move gl object handling to the window
 - different implementations for rays, boxes
 - clean up old resource arrays (lookin at you vao...)
 - clean examples
 - finish adding operators to ray classes
 - make more complete examples
 - documentation
 - take another look at buffers (and maybe redesign?)
 - add support for glsl array sizes to be defined by constants
 - figure out normal transformations for animations
 - find out what is up with SSBO objects holding vec3s (and maybe smaller vectors as well?)
 - fix the VAO constructor that takes an IBO as a parameter

 - TESTING
	- Ray2f (?)
	- Mesh collision
